        Hold The Line was a simple strategy card game. I wanted to explore the rock-paper-scissors triangle inside of a strategic card & board game. Players exchange turns placing military units in an attempt to
        break through their opponent's defense. Unfortunately, due to poor balance, the game goes on for significantly longer than desired or intended.

        The Midterm saw me designing a larger board game. I took inspiration from the Bloodborne board game with respect to difficult monsters, limited actions, and collaboration. 
        It took a while to create a bunch of cards for the game, and even now, the game could still use more cards. The concept appeared to work, however.

        Using Inform 7 as the engine, I created a short and simple parser game. Originally, there was a potion involved, but I could not figure out how to make it work.<br>        
        You and a friend foolishly experimented with lycanthropy curses. Now, your friend has turned into a werewolf, 
        intent on slaughtering you and anyone they can get their claws on. With little option, you have locked and shackled him in a cage. But now, you have to find a way to slay him before he can break free.

        Next, I used Twine to create a text adventure. I watned to play with minor supernatural elements as well as looping through the same set of rooms over and over (Think PT). <br>
        Trudging through a thunderstorm, you wish you had some shelter. You come across an old farm house along the road, and you consider the options of heading over or braving the elements further.

        Renpy offers a toolset for building a traditional visual novel using Python. While I am not a big fan of working in Python, the engine made it easy to quickly write branching narratives and paths. <br>

        Coming from a computer engineering undergraduate, I was already very confident in my programming skills. JavaScript, though completely unlike Java, is still a very flexible language.
        We played around with p5, a drawing and canvas library, which allowed us to draw the objects we created. In this sample, we were still using a roundabout method of creating objects
        using several arrays. However, what I created is still visually interesting.

        As we will be using Unity next semester, I decided to dive in right away. Thus, I created a simple bullet hell game, leveraging the power of Unity's prefab objects,
        C# code, and the free assets on the Asset Store. As expected, the game started as a bunch of temporary assets before being replaced by the ones found on the store. <br>
